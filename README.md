#Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
##Overview
This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game built with JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts, such as DOM manipulation and event handling.

##How to Play
To play the game, simply click on one of the three buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will randomly choose its move, and the winner will be determined based on the rules of the game.

The first player to reach a score of 5 will be declared the winner. If you want to start a new game, simply refresh the page.
